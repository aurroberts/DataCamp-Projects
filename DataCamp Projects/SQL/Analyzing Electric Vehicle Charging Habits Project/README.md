# Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I used a dataset to help apartment building managers better understand their tenanats' EV charging habits.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (COUNT, DISTINCT, aliasing, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, LIMIT)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Identified the number of unique individuals that use each garage's shared charging stations
- Listed the top 10 most popular charging start times
- Calculated the average charging duration for shared charging stations

## Files
- 'notebook.ipynb': Interactive analysis
- 'charging_station.jpg': Visual header

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook in a PostgreSQL-connect Jupyter environment or view it using GitHub's built-in notebook renderer.
