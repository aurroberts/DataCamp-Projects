# Analyzing Students' Mental Health Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the student table data using PostgreSQL to find out if international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (ROUND function, IS NOT NULL, filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Explored and analyzed the students data to see how the length of stay impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study
- Removed students who's stay is missing

## Files
- 'notebook.ipynb': Interactive analysis
- 'mentalhealth.jpg': Visual header
- 'students.csv': Table queried from

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook in a PostgreSQL-connect Jupyter environment or view it using GitHub's built-in notebook renderer.
