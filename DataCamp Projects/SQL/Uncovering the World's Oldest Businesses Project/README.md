# Uncovering the World's Oldest Businesses Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the following question: What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time? To answer this question, I used joining and data manipulation to work with this data and better understand the world's oldest businesses.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (JOINs, subqueries, filtering, aggregating, and sorting data)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Identified the oldest business in each continent using INNER JOINs and subqueries
- Calculated how many countries per continent lacked data on the oldest businesses and if including new businesses data changed it
- Determined which businesses categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent they are.
