# Cleaning a PostgreSQL Database (DataCamp)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing sales data from a fictional Super Store using PostgreSQL. The goal was to identify top product categories by profit, detect and handle missing values, and practice using window functions and CTEs in SQL.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (Window Functions, JOINs, CTEs)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Ranked top products per category by total sales and profit using RANK() and PARTITION BY
- Detected missing quantity values and calculated imputed unit prices with a multi-step CTE
- Created reusable SQL queries for reporting and exploration

## Files
- 'notebook.ipynb': Interactive analysis
- 'Project_Image.jpeg': Visual header

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook in a PostgreSQL-connect Jupyter environment or view it using GitHub's built-in notebook renderer.
